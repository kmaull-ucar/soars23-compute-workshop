Welcome to SOARS 2023 Computational Thinking Workshop
=====================================================


Welcome to the 2023 SOARS Computational Thinking Workshop!

The goals of this workshop are manifold, but by the end of the summer you will:

[**Scientific**] 
* have a broader understanding of the role computational thinking plays in scientific research
* understand some of the tools and workflows for modern scientific research
* understand the importance of open science, data, reproducibility, sharing and archiving in modern research

[**Python**] 
* get some exposure to [Python](https://python.org) and how to use it for a variety of basic to complex problems
* develop an understanding of the core libraries for general Python and geosciences Python
* get hands-on experience with Jupyter Lab / Notebooks

[**Software**] 
* understand the importance of platforms like Github to discover, reuse, learn and share
