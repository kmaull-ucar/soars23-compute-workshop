Welcome to SOARS 2023 Computational Thinking Workshop
=====================================================


Welcome to the 2023 SOARS Computational Thinking Workshop!

The goals of this workshop are manifold, but by the end of the summer you will:

**Explore Scientific Computing** to:

* develop a broader understanding of the role computational thinking plays in scientific research
* understand some of the tools and workflows for modern scientific research
* understand the importance of open science, data, reproducibility, sharing and archiving in modern research

**Develop Python skills** to:
* get [Python](https://python.org) exposure and learn how to the language for a variety of basic to complex problems in scientific computing
* develop an understanding of the core libraries for general Python and geosciences Python
* get hands-on experience with Jupyter Lab / Notebooks

**Build a software toolkit** to: 
* understand the importance of platforms like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to understand how to structure, organize, execute, explain and share your project code
* explore the Python libraries and support tools that will increase your productivity and code effectiveness
* understand how to use [Github](https://github.com) (among others) and the role [open source software]() plays in scientific discovery, reuse, learning and sharing 

**Explore research and computing skills** which include:
* effective communication and documentation of your code
* understanding the role of data citation and open source software
