# Tools, Guides and Inspiration

## Python and Jupyter

* [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

## Research Discovery

There are a number of research discover tools that you may have access to
on your campus, but here are some that do not require subscriptions (to search):

* [**SemanticScholar**](https://semanticscholar.org): exceptional tool for modern discovery tactics
* [**Dimensions.ai**](https://dimensions.ai): excellent tool for additional discovery; many additional features for discovering domain research
* **GoogleScholar**: classic tool, but has poor integration with DOI importation and can provide spurious results; often useful for finding author PDFs when publisher version is paywalled
* [**Awesome Open Science** (Github)](https://github.com/ZoranPandovski/awesome-open-science):

## Scientific Workflow

* [**Open Science Framework**](https://osf.io/): designed to promote computational workflows, transparency and collaboration across many disciplines

## AI Tools

* [**phind**](https://www.phind.com/): an AI search engine for developers and great resource to help with your coding experiences

## Citation and Bibliographic Management

* [**Zotero**](https://zotero.org): free, very useful and low barrier bibliographic management
    * [use Zotero browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/): essential, must-have tool! 
* [**Mendeley**](https://mendeley.com): excellent bibliographic and research management platform

## Code Management

* [**git**](https://git-scm.org): the open-source distributed revision control system for everything technical and upon which many front-ends are built; learning it will change your life
* [**Github**](https://github.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; the "OG" of open source Git hosting small and large
* [**Gitlab**](https://gitlab.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; can be [Linux self-hosted](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), but without some effort 
* [**Bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/): one of the big three and still an excellent alternative
* [**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/) privacy-respecting open source code hosting
* [**Gitea**](https://gitea.org): feeling like self-hosting? -- this open source project is an awesome lightweight alternative for solo and small teams and gives you full control of your code hosting

## Writing

* **Distraction-free writing**: [theory](https://), [practice](https://) and some [fun](https://)
* [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/): easy, distration-free markup writing for durability and portability; takes minutes to learn
* [**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org): free, open source conversion tool "swiss army knife" of document formats 
* Scientific writing in Markdown
    * [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) by Dennis Tennen and Grant Wythoff
    * [RMarkdown for writing reproducible scientific papers
](https://libscie.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop/handout.html) by Mike Frank & Chris Hartgerink
    * [Awesome Scientific Writing](https://writing-resources.github.io/awesome-scientific-writing/) 
* [**$\LaTeX$**](https://www.latex-project.org/): a rabbit hole perhaps not worth going down ... but with a cheat sheet you can be used to seemlessly integrate mathematics into your Markdown writing
    * [LaTeX Math cheat sheet](https://joshua.smcvt.edu/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf) for undergraduates
    * [*OverLeaf*](https://overleaf.com) : helps overcome some of the LaTeX barriers and encourage collaboration

## Data Science and Data Analytics

* [Earth Data Analytics Online Certificate](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/)
    * an excellent resource to be aware of even if you don't want to get the certificate!
