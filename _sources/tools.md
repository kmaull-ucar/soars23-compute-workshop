# Tools, Guides and Inspiration

## Python and Jupyter

* [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

## Research Discovery

There are a number of research discover tools that you may have access to
on your campus, but here are some that do not require subscriptions (to search):

* [**SemanticScholar**](https://semanticscholar.org): exceptional tool for modern discovery tactics
* [**Dimensions.ai**](https://dimensions.ai): excellent tool for additional discovery; many additional features for discovering domain research
* **GoogleScholar**: classic tool, but has poor integration with DOI importation and can provide spurious results; often useful for finding author PDFs when publisher version is paywalled


## AI Tools

* [phind](https://www.phind.com/): an AI search engine for developers and great resource to help with your coding experiences

## Citation and Bibliographic Management

* [**Zotero**](https://zotero.org): free, very useful and low barrier bibliographic management
    * [use Zotero browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/): essential, must-have tool! 

## Code Management

* [**git**](https://git-scm.org): the open-source distributed revision control system for everything technical and upon which many front-ends are built; learning it will change your life
* [**Github**](https://github.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; the "OG" of open source Git hosting small and large
* [**Gitlab**](https://gitlab.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; can be [Linux self-hosted](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), but without some effort 
* [**Bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/): one of the big three and still an excellent alternative
* [**Gitea**](https://gitea.org): feeling like self-hosting? -- this open source project is an awesome lightweight alternative for solo and small teams and gives you full control of your code hosting

## Writing

* **Distraction-free writing**: [theory](https://), [practice](https://) and some [fun](https://)
* [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/): easy, distration-free markup writing for durability and portability; takes minutes to learn
* [**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org): free, open source conversion tool "swiss army knife" of document formats 
* Guide to [scientific writing in Markdown]()
* [**$\LaTeX$**](https://www.latex-project.org/): a rabbit hole perhaps not worth going down ... but with a cheat sheet you can be used to seemlessly integrate mathematics into your Markdown writing
    * [LaTeX Math cheat sheet](https://joshua.smcvt.edu/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf) for undergraduates
    * [*OverLeaf*](https://overleaf.com) : helps overcome some of the LaTeX barriers and encourage collaboration

## Data Science and Data Analytics

* [Earth Data Analytics Online Certificate](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/)
    * an excellent resource to be aware of even if you don't want to get the certificate!
