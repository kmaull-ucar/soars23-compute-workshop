# Tools, Guides and Inspiration

## Research Discovery

There are a number of research discover tools that you may have access to
on your campus, but here are some that do not require subscriptions (to search):

* [SemanticScholar](https://semanticscholar.org): exceptional tool for modern discovery tactics
* [Dimensions.ai](https://dimensions.ai): excellent tool for additional discovery; many additional features for discovering domain research
* GoogleScholar: classic tool, but has poor integration with DOI importation and can provide spurious results; often useful for finding author PDFs when publisher version is paywalled


## Citation and Bibliographic Management

* [**Zotero**](https://zotero.org): free, very useful and low barrier bibliographic management
    * [use Zotero browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/): essential, must-have tool! 

## Code Management

* [**Github**](https://github.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; the "OG" of open source Git hosting small and large
* [**Gitlab**](https://gitlab.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; can be [Linux self-hosted](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), but without some effort 
* [**Bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/): one of the big three and still an excellent alternative
* [**Gitea**](https://gitea.org): feeling like self-hosting? -- this open source project is an awesome lightweight alternative for solo and small teams and gives you full control of your code hosting

## Writing
